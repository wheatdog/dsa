\begin{homeworkProblem}{Skip List, Binary Search Tree}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
        \item Do Exercise C-9.15 of the textbook.

            For every node, also store the width of the link. The width is 
            defined as the number of bottom layer links being traversed by each
            of the higher layer "express lane" links. Following is 
            Example from \texttt{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip\_list\#Indexable\_skiplist}

    \begin{verbatim}

            \begin{algorithm}[]
                \begin{algorithmic}[1]
                    \Function{Median}{}
                    \State{node $\gets$ head}
                    \State{remain $\gets \left \lfloor{\frac{n}{2}}\right \rfloor $}
                    \While{\Call{Below}{node} $\neq$ null}
                    \State{node $\gets$ \Call{Below}{node}}
                        \While{remain $\geq$ \Call{Width}{node}}
                            \State{remain $\gets$ remain $-$ \Call{Width}{node}}
                            \State{node $\gets$ \Call{After}{node}}
                        \EndWhile
                    \EndWhile
                    \State{\Return{node}}
                    \EndFunction{}
                \end{algorithmic}
                \caption{Find the median element}
            \end{algorithm}
            We can use \alg{Width} function to get the width in $O(1)$ since we
            store the value. This \alg{Median} function involes two nested 
            \alg{while} loops. One performs a scan forward, and the other drops 
            down to the next level. Since the height $h$ of $S$ is $O(\log n)$
            with high probability, the number og drop-down steps is $O(\log n)$
            with high probability. Let $n_i$ be the number of keys examined while
            scanning forward at level $i$. We can easily observe that, after the
            key at the starting postion, each additional key examined in a 
            scan-forward at level $i$ cannot also belong to level $i+1$. If any
            of these keys were on the previous level, we would have encountered
            them in the previous level. Thus, the expected value of $n_i$ is 
            exactly equal to the expected number of times we must flip a fair
            coin before it comes up heads, That is 2. Hence, the expected amount
            of time spent scanning forward at any level $i$ is $O(1)$. Since
            $S$ has $O(\log n)$ levels with high probability, this \alg{Median}
            function in $S$ takes expected time $O(\log n)$.


            
        \item Do Exercise R-10.5 of the textbook.

            Consider these two input orders, $\left\{\,1,3,2,4,5\,\right\}$ and
            $\left\{\,4,2,1,5,3\,\right\}$. Note that these two sets contain
            same entries $\left\{\,1,2,3,4,5\,\right\}$. We can easily find 
            that they generate different trees.
            \begin{figure}[h]
                \Tree [.1 $\square$ [ [ $\square$ $\square$ ].2 [ $\square$ [ $\square$ $\square$ ].5 ].4 ].3 ]
                \Tree [.4 [ [ $\square$ $\square$ ].1 [ $\square$ $\square$ ].3 ].2 [ $\square$ $\square$ ].5 ]
                \caption{Left tree generates from $\left\{\,1,3,2,4,5\,\right\}$,
                and right tree generates from $\left\{\,4,2,1,5,3\,\right\}$.}
            \end{figure}

            We conclude that the order of insertion does matter.

        \item Do Exercise C-10.12 of the textbook.

\begin{homeworkProblem}{Balanced Binary Search Trees}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
        \item
            Write a program \texttt{hw6\_2} that reads 32 strings (of length at
            most 128 that can be compared lexicographically) line by line (each 
            line containing one string) from \texttt{stdin} and inserts them to
            the AVL tree (\texttt{avl.c}), height-bounded binary search tree 
            (\texttt{bst.c}), and Red-Black tree (\texttt{rb.c}). Please output
            the resulting trees (pre-order) to \texttt{stdout} with specific
            format.

\begin{homeworkProblem}{Disjoint Set}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
        \item
            Prove that the disjoint-set forest with this heuristic yields a 
            worst-case running time for find and union within $O(\log n)$.

            \pending

        \item
            Suppose that you only need to output $u$ rather than $u$ and $k$ for
            this problem. Write down the pseudo-code of an efficient algorithm
            based on the disjoint forest.

            \pending

        \item
            Suppose that the prices of your friend $u$'s games are stored in a
            balanced BST as keys, and you have access to the size and the sum of
            all keys of any subtree of the BST in an $O(1)$ time, write down the
            pseudo-code of an efficient algorithm for outputting $k$ for the 
            particular $u$.

            \pending

        \item
            If we take the same heuristic as (1) and always insert the elements
            of the smaller BST into the bigger one, prove that processing all
            incidents of the first kind takes $O(n(\log n) 2)$ time.

            \pending

        \item Write a program \texttt{hw6\_3} to solve the problem efficiently.
