\begin{homeworkProblem}{Skip List, Binary Search Tree}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
        \item Do Exercise C-9.15 of the textbook.

            \pending

        \item Do Exercise R-10.5 of the textbook.

            \pending

        \item Do Exercise C-10.12 of the textbook.

            \pending

\begin{homeworkProblem}{Balanced Binary Search Trees}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
        \item
            Write a program \texttt{hw6\_2} that reads 32 strings (of length at
            most 128 that can be compared lexicographically) line by line (each 
            line containing one string) from \texttt{stdin} and inserts them to
            the AVL tree (\texttt{avl.c}), height-bounded binary search tree 
            (\texttt{bst.c}), and Red-Black tree (\texttt{rb.c}). Please output
            the resulting trees (pre-order) to \texttt{stdout} with specific
            format. 

            \pending

    \end{enumerate}

\begin{homeworkProblem}{Disjoint Set}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
        \item
            Prove that the disjoint-set forest with this heuristic yields a 
            worst-case running time for find and union within $O(\log n)$.

            \pending

        \item
            Suppose that you only need to output $u$ rather than $u$ and $k$ for
            this problem. Write down the pseudo-code of an efficient algorithm
            based on the disjoint forest.

            \pending

        \item
            Suppose that the prices of your friend $u$'s games are stored in a
            balanced BST as keys, and you have access to the size and the sum of
            all keys of any subtree of the BST in an $O(1)$ time, write down the
            pseudo-code of an efficient algorithm for outputting $k$ for the 
            particular $u$.

            \pending

        \item
            If we take the same heuristic as (1) and always insert the elements
            of the smaller BST into the bigger one, prove that processing all
            incidents of the first kind takes $O(n(\log n) 2)$ time.

            \pending

        \item Write a program hw6 3 to solve the problem efficiently.

            \pending[code part]
